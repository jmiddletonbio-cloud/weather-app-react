# Weather App React

A React-based weather application with a glassmorphism UI that displays current weather conditions for any location.

## API Key Setup

This application uses the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to fetch weather data.

### Setting Up Your API Key

1. Sign up for a free API key at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
2. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
3. Add your API key to the `.env` file:
   ```
   REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

### Security Notes

- The `.env` file is git-ignored and should never be committed to version control
- For production deployments, configure the API key through your CI/CD environment variables (e.g., GitHub Secrets)
- The API key is embedded in the client-side bundle at build time, which is expected for OpenWeatherMap's architecture
- For production use, configure domain restrictions and rate limiting in your OpenWeatherMap dashboard to protect your API key

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
